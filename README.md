**## The Weather Forecast Dashboard is a full-stack web application developed using Python and Flask that allows users to view live weather forecasts for any city around the world, complemented by visual data representations and a dynamic map interface. This project integrates several powerful tools and APIs, including the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch real-time and forecasted weather data, Matplotlib and Seaborn for generating graphical temperature trends, and Mapbox for rendering a visually appealing interactive map based on the user's search location. When a user enters a city name in the provided search form, the Flask backend sends a request to the OpenWeatherMap API, retrieves the next few hours of forecast data (including temperature, humidity, and weather description), and then processes this data to extract temperature and time intervals. This data is plotted into a temperature-vs-time line chart using Seaborn, saved as an image, and displayed on the same page alongside the textual weather information. In parallel, the application also integrates Mapbox, which utilizes the city’s coordinates to display a pinpointed location on a responsive map embedded in the dashboard, giving users a spatial context for their weather query. The entire frontend is built with HTML and styled using modern CSS techniques to ensure a clean, mobile-friendly, and visually engaging user interface. A weather-themed background image sourced via URL (e.g., from Unsplash) enhances the visual appeal, while thoughtful styling—such as a bright yellow heading for “Weather Report,” rounded input boxes, soft shadows, and a transparent overlay for displaying weather details—ensures readability and user interaction clarity. The project folder includes a Python script (app.py) which serves as the core logic, handling route definitions, API calls, data visualization, and image generation, along with index.html for the layout and a static folder for serving the chart and background image. The project requires installation of several dependencies via pip install flask requests matplotlib seaborn, and optionally, python-dotenv to securely manage API keys. The final app runs locally using the Flask development server and can be accessed via a web browser, where users simply input a city to view an instant snapshot of that location’s current weather, a forecast graph, and a Mapbox-generated map. The app provides a foundational example of how to blend real-time data APIs with data visualization libraries and frontend frameworks to create a useful and elegant tool. It also demonstrates key programming concepts such as API consumption, asynchronous data handling, dynamic rendering, and modular web development. The inclusion of Mapbox adds an extra layer of functionality, allowing users not only to understand the weather conditions but also to see the exact location visually, making the application suitable for travelers, weather enthusiasts, or as a learning project in data science and full-stack development. Future improvements could include adding multi-day forecasts, icons representing weather conditions, location auto-complete suggestions, and the ability to store or share previously searched locations. In conclusion, this project successfully combines backend Python logic, data-driven visualizations, and a visually rich frontend, offering a seamless and informative weather dashboard experience with both numerical insights and geographic context.
